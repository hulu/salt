Description: This package represents the client package for salt
 This package is a powerful remote execution manager that can be used
 to administer servers in a fast and efficient way.

 It allows commands to be executed across large groups of servers. This
 means systems can be easily managed, but data can also be easily gathered.
 Quick introspection into running systems becomes a reality.

 Remote execution is usually used to set up a certain state on a remote
 system. Salt addresses this problem as well, the salt state system uses
 salt state files to define the state a server needs to be in.

 the backbone of cloud and data center management.
